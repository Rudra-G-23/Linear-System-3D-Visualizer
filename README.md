## **🖥️ About the Project**  
This interactive web application helps users **visualize and solve systems of linear equations** in both **2D (two variables) and 3D (three variables).** Using **Streamlit and Plotly**, this app provides an intuitive way to explore equations and understand their solutions.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
✅ Visual representation of **2-variable** and **3-variable** linear equations  
✅ **Real-time equation manipulation** to see the effect on solutions  
✅ **Customization options** for colors and styles  
✅ **Mathematical insights** on solution types: Unique, Infinite, or No Solution  

This hands-on approach makes **learning linear algebra engaging and interactive!** 🚀
